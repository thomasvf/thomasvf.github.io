I graduated *summa cum laude* in Computer Engineering from UFRGS[^1] in 2021 and obtained my master's degree in Computer Science from the same university in 2023. Currently, I'm employed as a Data Scientist at Petrobras. Outside of work, I collaborate on ML and signal processing research projects with my previous labs.

My primary interests include signal processing (image, video and graphs), machine learning and algorithm design (including CUDA).
