During the Covid-19 pandemic, at Wille Engineering, we partnered with Latai GmbH to develop an affordable embedded solution that extracts useful information from low-resolution thermal pictures.
The system we developed can find a person's face, check if they're wearing a mask or glasses, and estimate their forehead's temperature accurately.

In this project, I participated on the development of the software and algorithms to process the thermal sensor data, and on the creation of the GUI to show the extracted information.
